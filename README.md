# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Ion currents underlying sinoatrial node pacemaker activity: a new single cell mathematical model.**

**Abstract:**   
The ionic currents underlying autorhythmicity of the mammalian sinoatrial node
and their wider contribution to each phase of the action potential have been
investigated in this study using a new single cell mathematical model. The new
model provides a review and update of existing formulations of sinoatrial node
membrane currents, derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data
available in the literature. Simulations of spontaneous activity suggest that
the dominant mechanism underlying pacemaker depolarisation is the inward
background Na+ current, ib,Na. In contrast to previous models, the decay of
the delayed rectifying K+ current, iK, was insignificant during this phase.
Despite the presence of a pseudo-outward background current throughout the
pacemaker range of potentials (Na-K pump+leak currents), the
hyperpolarisation-activated current i(f) was not essential to pacemaker
activity. A closer inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of the
model revealed that the "instantaneous" time-independent current was inward
for holding potentials in the pacemaker range, which rapidly became outward
within 2 ms due to the inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, iCa,L. This
suggests that reports in the literature in which the net background current is
outward throughout the pacemaker range of potentials may be exaggerated. The
magnitudes of the action potential overshoot and the maximum diastolic
potential were determined largely by the reversal potentials of iCa,L and iK
respectively. The action potential was sustained by the incomplete
deactivation of iCa,L and the Na-Ca exchanger, iNaCa. Despite the
incorporation of "square-root" activation by [K]o of all K+ currents, the
model was unable to correctly simulate the response to elevated [K]o.
